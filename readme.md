# Vale MCP Server

> Very early days.

1. You need Vale installed and in your PATH.
2. Clone the repo.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. [Follow these instructions](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#testing-your-server-with-claude-for-desktop).

And you should receive responses based on the current style guide rules that Vale sees relative to your path. That's about it for nowâ€¦

For development, much the same as above, but to test changes, run `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript, then reload Claude (or whatever client you are using) to pick up the changes.
